            <h3>The Building Blocks üöÄ</h3>
            <p>The system is designed by distributing tasks across multiple Raspberry Pi Pico boards, each connected to a different set of sensors:</p>

            <h4>Sensor Integration üî¢</h4>
            <p>Each sensor plays a crucial role in ensuring optimal growing conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CO2 Sensor (SCD41):</strong> Measures carbon dioxide levels to optimize photosynthesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Mikroe Spectrometer Click (AS7341):</strong> Monitors light intensity across various wavelengths to regulate artificial lighting.</li>
                <li><strong>SparkFun Air Velocity Sensor (FS3000-1005):</strong> Measures air velocity to ensure proper ventilation and prevent stagnant air.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Moisture Sensor:</strong> Measures soil moisture to regulate water delivery based on plant needs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>System Architecture üíª</h4>
            <img src="images/fulls/embeddedsystem.png" alt="Hydroponics System Architecture" />
            <p>The diagram above illustrates the overall architecture of the hydroponics system. It consists of multiple Raspberry Pi Pico boards, each dedicated to specific functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pico A:</strong> Handles plant monitoring tasks by reading data from sensors such as the CO2 sensor and Mikroe Spectrometer Click. It publishes sensor readings via MQTT topics for CO2 levels, light intensity, and LED control.</li>
                <li><strong>Pico B:</strong> Responsible for wind control. It uses an air velocity sensor to monitor airflow and activates a fan when required. Data is shared via MQTT topics related to airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Pico C:</strong> Manages water supply by controlling a water pump. It uses a relay module to regulate the water flow based on soil moisture levels, publishing and subscribing to relevant MQTT topics.</li>
                <li><strong>Pico D:</strong> Acts as the main controller, subscribing to all topics and making decisions based on the data received. It coordinates actions such as activating the water pump or fan by publishing commands to the respective Pico boards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The architecture leverages MQTT for efficient communication, ensuring that each Pico W operates in sync with the system. Additionally, the modular design allows for easy expansion, where new Picos can dynamically join the network by identifying themselves through dedicated MQTT topics and receiving configuration updates from the master Pico. This setup enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency.</p>

            <h4>System Configuration Flow ü§ñ</h4>
            <p>The project begins with an interactive terminal interface on a connected MacBook Pro:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The farmer is prompted to select the power mode:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mode 1:</strong> Low power mode - All sensors and Picos operate with minimal power consumption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mode 2:</strong> Normal mode - Full performance with no power restrictions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Next, the farmer selects a plant configuration from predefined options. Each configuration file specifies the optimal environmental conditions for that plant (e.g., temperature, soil moisture, light intensity).</li>
                <li>Once the selections are made, the Picos store the configuration values locally and begin monitoring their respective sensors. If any sensor data deviates from the configured thresholds, appropriate actions are triggered, such as activating the fan or stopping the water pump.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Relay Control ‚öñÔ∏è</h4>
            <p>The relay module controls the water pump and fan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Pump:</strong> Delivers water and nutrients directly to the plant roots. If soil moisture exceeds a set threshold, the pump is stopped to prevent overwatering.</li>
                <li><strong>Fan:</strong> Maintains proper air circulation to prevent mould and improve air quality. If temperature exceeds the configured limit, the fan is activated to cool the environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Communication Protocol üì¢</h4>
            <p>MQTT is used as the communication protocol between the Raspberry Pi Pico boards:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Publishers and Subscribers:</strong> Each Pico acts as both a publisher and a subscriber, enabling them to exchange sensor data and configuration information seamlessly.</li>
                <li><strong>Topics:</strong> CO2 levels, light intensity, air velocity, soil moisture, water pump control, and fan control are published as topics for the Picos to act upon.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Pico Integration:</strong> Each new Pico W that joins the system publishes an identification message to a specific MQTT topic. The master Pico responds by sending the necessary configuration and command topics, ensuring that the new Pico can immediately begin operating in sync with the system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Power Management üî¶</h4>
            <p>Low power mode features were incorporated into the Raspberry Pi Pico W boards and the sensors to enhance energy efficiency. Each Pico was programmed to enter low-power mode when idle, and the sensors were also configured to operate in low-power mode when continuous monitoring was not required. This approach ensures that the overall energy consumption of the system is minimized, making it sustainable for long-term use.</p>
            <p>The project also allows farmers to select different power configurations based on their specific needs. This flexibility ensures that farmers can prioritize either performance or energy efficiency depending on the stage of plant growth and environmental conditions.</p>

            <h3>Code Implementation üíª</h3>
            <p>The system is programmed in C, with each Pico handling a specific task. Here are the key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensor Drivers:</strong> Custom drivers were developed to interface with each sensor.</li>
                <li><strong>MQTT Communication:</strong> Implemented using lightweight MQTT libraries to enable seamless data exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Relay Control Logic:</strong> Based on sensor data, the relay module triggers the water pump and fan.</li>
                <li><strong>Power Management Logic:</strong> Low-power modes were implemented by controlling the Pico's sleep cycles and sensor duty cycles, ensuring energy efficiency without compromising performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Configuration Handling:</strong> Each Pico stores the selected plant configuration locally. Upon receiving data from subscribed topics or their own sensors, the Picos compare the readings with the configuration and take necessary actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Pico Synchronization:</strong> New Picos can join the ecosystem dynamically by identifying themselves through MQTT. The master Pico assigns tasks and configuration settings, ensuring that the new devices integrate seamlessly with the existing setup.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Final Product</h3>
            <p>The final product is a robust and scalable hydroponics system that can be easily expanded by adding more sensors or control units. This modular approach ensures that the system remains efficient and easy to maintain while supporting optimal plant growth. Additionally, the customizable power configurations provide flexibility for farmers, enabling them to optimize the system according to their specific operational requirements.</p>
